# Project 2 - Restaurant Website

You've been asked to design a website for a new restaurant opening at
348 E. Main St., Lexington, KY. The owners are busy working on their
recipes and haven't picked a name yet, so they've asked you to suggest
one and use it in your design.

The website needs to include at least:
- The restaurant's name (give it a good one!)
- The restaurant's address
- The restaurant's hours of operation:
	Wednesday through Saturday, dinner only: 5pm - 10pm
	Sunday, brunch and dinner: 11am - 8pm
- The restaurant's menu (including at least 8 entrees)

The owners are still working on their recipes. They've populated an
API with possible choices. You are to use the API to generate a sample
menu to add to your website. The API's URL is:

	https://entree-f18.herokuapp.com/

Use the tools and technologies covered in class to complete your website.
Minimally, that includes:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git
- Github
- Heroku or Github Pages for deployment

You may also use:
- Bootstrap
- Sass
- anything else you've learned on your own.

To turn in your project, add your Github repo and deployed app links to
your page in the Class Notes project.

If you have time, consider the following additions to your project:

1. Include a different menu for each day of the week that the restaurant
is open.

2. Embed a Google Map showing the location of the restaurant.

3. Parse the results of the API call to show a list of sides available for
substitution (either in addition to or instead of listing sides with each entree).

Of course, you are also free to make your own additions.

Have fun!
